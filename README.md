Hello! I'm Mitra Maleki, a  physics student currently working at the Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM) and the Iran National Observatory (INO). I hold a Bachelor's in Physics from Sharif University of Technology, where I developed my interest in Cosmology, Astronomy, and Astrophysics. I enjoy observing, but further I am interested in data science and data analysis, so I am trying to expand my knowledge and learn new things((:



### Ongoing Project


## Python Development for Iran National Observatory

In the summer of 2024, I joined the Iran National Observatory project at IPM, working under the supervision of Dr. Amin Farhang. My role involves creating the core algorithms and data analysis methods needed for astronomical observations, similar to the European Southern Observatory's (ESO) work.
