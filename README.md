Hello! I'm Mitra Maleki, a physics student currently exploring the wonders of the universe. Growing up, I was the kid who dreamed of working at NASA, staring up at the stars and wondering what secrets they held. Now, with a Bachelor's in Physics from Sharif University of Technology, I’ve turned that dream into a journey—one that’s led me to dive deep into Astrophysics, Astronomy, and Cosmology. While I enjoy stargazing and observational work, I'm also diving deeper into data science and data analysis! I mostly work with Python, but recently, I have been learning C++, too.

### Current Project

## Deep Dive into Weinberg's Cosmology

Right now, I'm immersed in an individual study of Weinberg’s Cosmology, working with Dr. Ali Akbar Abolhasani. This project is all about exploring the early universe, revisiting key theories, and refining our understanding of cosmological phenomena. It’s a big step for me through theoretical astrophysics, and I love every moment of it!

### Previous Project

## Python Development for Iran National Observatory

In the summer of 2024, I had the exciting opportunity to work at the Iran National Observatory under the guidance of Dr. Amin Farhang. My work involved developing Python algorithms and data analysis tools for astronomical observations, similar to the work done at the European Southern Observatory (ESO). It was an experience that fueled my passion for coding.

Feel free to reach out to me at [Email](mailto:mitramalekiy@gmail.com)! I’m always excited to hear from others who share a passion for the stars, coding, or just curious minds wanting to exchange ideas. Let’s connect and learn from each other!
Also, please send me your comments on my codes; it will help me to improve day by day.(:
